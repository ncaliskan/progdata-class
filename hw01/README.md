## My Repository :information_desk_person:
**My repository is basically consisting of a few files for now**
1. gitignore file should basically  be ignored :P
2. The hw-ncaliskan project document is where I will add my code once I complete my homework 1.
3. The navigating github files was for me trying to get familiar with github and R. 

## Who am I? :bowtie:
