# Welcome to my Homework 1!

***Hello everyone!!*** :hear_no_evil:
This is Neslihan Caliskan, welcome to my **class repository**! A repository is a online place where we all can keep the files and codes we worked on in a single space and easily make edits on them.

## My Repository
**My repository is basically consisting of a few files for now**
1. gitignore file should basically  be ignored :P
2. The hw-ncaliskan project document is where I will add my code once I complete my homework 1.
3. The navigating github files was for me trying to get familiar with github and R. 

## Who am I?
This is **Neslihan Caliskan**, I am a senior studying Psychology and Linguistics and trying to get familiar with R so that I could work on analyzing data for my honors thesis projects easily.
